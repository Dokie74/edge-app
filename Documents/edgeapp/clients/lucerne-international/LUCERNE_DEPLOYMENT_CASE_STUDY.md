# üéØ Lucerne International Deployment Case Study
**From EDGE Development to Client Production**

> **Summary:** This document chronicles our journey deploying the EDGE employee performance management system for our first client, Lucerne International. It serves as both a post-mortem and a guide for future client deployments.

## üìà Project Overview

### Timeline: August 10-11, 2025
- **Start:** Fresh Vercel deployment attempt
- **Challenges:** 6+ hours of troubleshooting  
- **End Result:** ‚úÖ Successful deployment with working admin authentication

### Key Achievement
üéâ **Successfully deployed:** https://lucerne-edge-app.vercel.app  
‚úÖ **Admin login working:** dokonoski@lucerneintl.com  
‚úÖ **Multi-tenant architecture:** Ready for additional clients

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Transition

### From Development to Production

**Original EDGE Development:**
- Single-tenant development environment
- Database: `blssdohlfcmyhxtpalcf.supabase.co`
- Local development and testing

**Lucerne Client Production:**  
- Multi-tenant architecture with `tenant_id = 'lucerne'`
- Dedicated database: `wvggehrxhnuvlxpaghft.supabase.co`
- Production deployment at `lucerne-edge-app.vercel.app`

### Multi-Tenant Implementation
```sql
-- Every table includes tenant isolation
tenant_id text DEFAULT 'lucerne'

-- Row Level Security ensures data separation
CREATE POLICY "tenant_isolation_employees" 
ON public.employees FOR ALL 
USING (tenant_id = COALESCE(current_setting('app.tenant_id', true), 'lucerne'));
```

## üöß Major Challenges Encountered

### 1. Vercel Build Configuration Issues
**Problem:** Initial deployment failures due to incorrect build settings

**Failed Attempts:**
- ‚ùå `rootDirectory: "edge-app"` - caused "react-scripts not found" 
- ‚ùå Node.js 18.x - deprecated, caused build failures
- ‚ùå Nested directory structure confusion

**Solution:** 
- ‚úÖ Empty root directory (app at repository root)  
- ‚úÖ Node.js 22.x
- ‚úÖ Correct `vercel.json` with SPA rewrites

### 2. Authentication & User Linking
**Problem:** Users could authenticate but weren't linked to employee records

**Symptoms:**
- `‚ö†Ô∏è User not found in employees table, using fallback logic`
- Admin role not recognized despite database showing correct role

**Root Cause:** Missing connection between `auth.users.id` and `employees.user_id`

**Solution:**
```sql
UPDATE employees 
SET user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'dokonoski@lucerneintl.com')
WHERE email = 'dokonoski@lucerneintl.com';
```

### 3. Row Level Security Infinite Recursion
**Problem:** Complex RLS policies caused database errors

**Error:** `infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "employees"`

**Failed Approach:** Nested subqueries in RLS policies that referenced the same table

**Solution:** Simplified RLS policies during deployment, add complexity later
```sql
-- Temporary permissive policy for initial deployment
CREATE POLICY "employees_authenticated_all" 
ON public.employees FOR ALL
TO authenticated 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
```

### 4. Database Function API Cache Issues
**Problem:** Created functions not appearing in Supabase REST API

**Symptoms:** 
- Functions work in SQL editor
- 404 errors when called via REST API
- PostgREST schema cache not refreshing

**Status:** Unresolved - app works with fallback data
**Workaround:** Graceful degradation to sample data

---

## üéØ What Worked Successfully

### 1. Database Schema Migration ‚úÖ
- Complete schema export from development
- Clean application to client database
- Proper foreign key relationships maintained

### 2. Authentication Flow ‚úÖ
- Supabase Auth integration working
- User signup/login functional
- Session management operational

### 3. Multi-Tenant Architecture ‚úÖ
- `tenant_id` columns throughout schema
- Client data isolation achieved
- Foundation for additional clients established

### 4. Admin Role Recognition ‚úÖ
- Database correctly identifies admin users
- `‚úÖ Found user in employees table: {role: 'admin', name: 'David Okonoski'}`
- Admin dashboard accessible

### 5. Production Deployment ‚úÖ
- Vercel hosting stable and fast
- Environment variables properly configured
- HTTPS and security features enabled

---

## üìä Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Database Architecture
**Decision:** Separate Supabase project per client  
**Rationale:** 
- Complete data isolation
- Independent scaling per client
- Simplified backup/recovery per client
- Client-specific access controls

### Deployment Strategy  
**Decision:** Vercel for frontend, Supabase for backend
**Rationale:**
- Automatic HTTPS and CDN
- Seamless GitHub integration
- Built-in environment variable management
- Excellent performance for React apps

### Authentication Approach
**Decision:** Supabase Auth with employee table linking
**Rationale:**
- Leverages battle-tested authentication
- Maintains employee role/permission data
- Supports future SSO integration
- Client-specific user management

---

## üí° Key Learnings

### Do's for Future Clients ‚úÖ
1. **Start with minimal RLS policies** - add complexity incrementally
2. **Test auth user linking immediately** after database setup  
3. **Keep repository structure clean** - React app at root level
4. **Use exact environment variable naming** - `REACT_APP_` prefix critical
5. **Apply database schema in order** - schema ‚Üí functions ‚Üí policies
6. **Test each layer independently** - database, API, frontend

### Don'ts - Lessons from Pain Points ‚ùå
1. **Don't use complex RLS on initial deployment** - infinite recursion risk
2. **Don't assume functions will be immediately available** - API cache delays
3. **Don't nest React app in subdirectories** - Vercel build issues  
4. **Don't skip user-to-employee linking verification** - auth will appear broken
5. **Don't deploy all features at once** - incremental deployment safer

### Process Improvements
1. **Create deployment checklist** - step-by-step verification
2. **Prepare rollback plan** - known working database states
3. **Test in staging first** - catch issues before client sees them
4. **Document working configurations** - avoid repeating trial-and-error
