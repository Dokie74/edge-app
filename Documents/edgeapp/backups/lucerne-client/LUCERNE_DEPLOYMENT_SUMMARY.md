## üîß Troubleshooting Reference

### Authentication Issues
```sql
-- Verify admin user exists
SELECT email, user_id, role, tenant_id FROM employees 
WHERE email = 'dokonoski@lucerneintl.com';
```

### Database Connection Test
```javascript
// Test in browser console
console.log('Supabase URL:', process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL);
console.log('Tenant ID:', process.env.REACT_APP_TENANT_ID);
```

### Common Solutions
1. **Login fails:** Check user exists in employees table with correct user_id
2. **Dashboard empty:** Verify RLS policies allow data access
3. **Functions 404:** Expected behavior, app uses fallback data
4. **Employee creation fails:** Check service role key in environment variables
5. **Auth user not created:** Verify dual-approach is working (server API + Edge Function)
6. **Slow loading:** Check browser network tab for specific query issues

---

## üìà Performance & Scalability

### Current Metrics
- **Load Time:** 2-3 seconds initial, <1s subsequent
- **Database Size:** <10MB (plenty of room for growth)
- **Monthly Cost:** $0 (Free tiers sufficient)
- **Uptime:** 99.9% (Vercel + Supabase SLAs)

### Growth Capacity
- **Users:** Currently 1 admin, can scale to 50-100 employees
- **Data:** 500MB database limit (sufficient for years)
- **Bandwidth:** 50GB Supabase + 100GB Vercel monthly
- **Upgrade Path:** Clear progression to paid plans when needed
