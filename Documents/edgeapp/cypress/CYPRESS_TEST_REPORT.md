## 🛠️ Technical Improvements Made

### Memory & Stability Optimizations
```javascript
// cypress.config.ts improvements
{
  numTestsKeptInMemory: 1,        // Reduced from 5
  requestTimeout: 10000,          // Added timeout controls
  responseTimeout: 10000,         // Added response limits
  defaultCommandTimeout: 8000,    // Reduced from 10000
  pageLoadTimeout: 60000          // Reduced from 120000
}
```

### Test Structure Fixes
- Fixed all beforeEach hooks across manager and admin tests
- Added proper `cy.visit('/dashboard')` calls
- Implemented session-cached authentication
- Created stable workflow test suite

### Command Enhancements
```javascript
// Enhanced custom commands
cy.login(role)                    // Session-cached API login
cy.waitForRoleBasedDashboard()   // Role-specific dashboard verification
cy.verifyNoUnauthorizedContent() // Access control validation
cy.setupApiInterception()        // Comprehensive API monitoring
```
